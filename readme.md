# Extra Time
This is a list of the extra things I did to achieve the goals for Frontend 3:

* Looking stuff up on [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) like:
  * How to create SVG elements like `polygon` and `text`
  * How to use standard Javascript stuff like statements, functions, arrays and operators
  * How to use methods for cleaning data like `slice()`, `splice()`, `indexOf()`, `trim()` and `replace()`
* Using the [D3 reference](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md) to look things up about D3
* Using the website of [Scott Murray](http://alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3) to understand D3 better (these tutorials address an older version of D3 but they explain everything very clearly, it helped me a lot)
* Viewing a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNbgrqRuoiE) about how to make a world map with D3 and topojson (still in progress, I do have a world map now because of that video but I haven't any data attached to it yet)
* Being active on the frontend 3 slack channel where I asked many questions and tried to help others
* A lot of googling. Often I found answers on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
